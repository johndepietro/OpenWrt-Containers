# OpenWrt-Containers
The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application. For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.
A Linux® container is a set of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system, running from a distinct image that provides all files necessary to support the processes. By providing an image that contains all of an application’s dependencies, it is portable and consistent as it moves from development, to testing, and finally to production. You can deploy containers for a number of workloads and use cases–big to small. Containers give your team the underlying technology needed for a modern approach to software development, such as DevOps and CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment). 
The ability to instal, manage and upgrade Linux containers on OpenWrt platforms in the customer edge (home or business) if the focus of this project.
